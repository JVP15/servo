# Overview

This is a quick program I wrote up to have the attachment to a servo motor always point upwards. However, It can only correct roll motion, not pitch. 

It prints the accelerometer output over serial. It can take an integer between 0 and 180 over serial, and instead of pointing upwards, the servo will maintain the given angle.
